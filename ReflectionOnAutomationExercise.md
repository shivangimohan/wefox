- This automation framework and the test written are useful in *Regression Testing*. Means in an agile development process QA test the current sprint tasks manually too and automate them but due to lack of time QA can not test already released features thoroughly but current sprint changes can introduce regression bugs too. So these tests will be helpful in regression tests and to check already released features are working fine.

- Unit Testing - Unit testing means when we test each small component functionality, for now in this framework we are trying to cover End to End functionality. To do Unit testing in this framework we need to write more component specific tests. 

- Integration Testing - If we cover here all the End to End scenarios we can use this automation framework for Integration Testing too.

- System Testing - If we cover here all the End to End scenarios we can use this automation framework for System Testing too.
